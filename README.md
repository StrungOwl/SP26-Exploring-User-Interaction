# SP25-Exploring-User-Interaction
All the scripts in this repo are for my Exploring User Interaction students.
Each folder contains a different website/project and contains html, css, and js scripts. 
The scripts were written either by me, Sydney, or by an LLM with my incredible prompting skills ;)
They are a combination of specific effects a student wants to achieve, or fundamental interactions/animations that I've mentioned in class.
